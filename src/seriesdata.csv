Together, they were The Sons of Liberty. Though their names have become American legend, few realize that this group of young radicals didn't start as noble patriots. They were a new American generation of young men from varied backgrounds trying to figure out what to do with their lives. What began as a small testing of authority would become an underground protest movement, inciting the British to respond with totalitarian tactics, cracking down on the colonies and instituting a near police state to maintain order. But after blood was spilled at the Boston Massacre, the Sons of Liberty rallied support for a larger cause. The Sons became guerilla warriors working underground, establishing spy networks, stockpiling weapons and planning covert actions - from the Boston Tea Party to the Battle of Lexington and Concord - that would lead to a declaration of independence and the greatest fight for freedom the world has ever seen.

A&E Television Network,5,Mail Call,"Charles Falco is one of only three men ever to infiltrate three different outlaw biker gangs. With his savvy and expertise, not to mention his immense courage, Falco has helped law enforcement bring some of America's most dangerous and feared gangs to justice. This first season of The Infiltrator takes us deep inside the notorious Vagos. Falco details this operation in the optioned book Vagos, Mongols, and Outlaws: My Infiltration of America's Deadliest Biker Gangs.

The History Channel,337,Investigating History,"Charles Falco is one of only three men ever to infiltrate three different outlaw biker gangs. With his savvy and expertise, not to mention his immense courage, Falco has helped law enforcement bring some of America's most dangerous and feared gangs to justice. This first season of The Infiltrator takes us deep inside the notorious Vagos. Falco details this operation in the optioned book Vagos, Mongols, and Outlaws: My Infiltration of America's Deadliest Biker Gangs. The real-life Donnie Brasco will meet Sons of Anarchy in a way that can be Gangland 2.0 for History.

Working in conjunction with law enforcement and drawing on the wealth of material from Falco's book, along with broader documented historical research of inter-gang rivalry, this series captures the reality of outlaw biker counter-culture: a world where freedom is equated with the right to carry guns and trade drugs with impunity, and respect can be earned through fear.
